<h2 class="has-nv-c-2-background-color has-background" id="htoc-what-is-an-internship">what is an internship?</h2>



<p>According to me, an internship is a limited period of time , working experience offered by an employer is given to students.</p>



<p>I classified internship into two types paid and voluntary internships.<br>The trend is now voluntary internships, they lot of organization offered voluntary internships.<br>As coming to paid internships, it is usually a lot competitive to select that internship. Yep! this is a competitive world. Don&#8217;t worry I give some ideas and tricks to get paid internships.. keep reading&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="has-nv-c-2-background-color has-background" id="htoc-how-to-apply-for-an-internship">how to apply for an internship?</h2>



<p>Basically there following different methods in various organization&#8230;let see detailed about.</p>



<ul><li>The high-level organization require to fill out an online application form.</li><li>sometimes they said to send an application through a general email address.</li><li>some organization says submit your resume or cv through the website portal.</li></ul>



<p>As a beginner, you fealing hard to find a good internship but my suggestion is to try &#8216;Internshala it&#8217;s an open free platform. I explained step by step how to get an internship through Internshala.</p>



<h2 class="has-nv-c-2-background-color has-background" id="htoc-what-is-internshala">what is Internshala?</h2>



<p>Internshala is India&#8217;s big internship platform, it connects the organization looking for interns and students who are interested in the internship and, with 40000+ paid internships in Engineering, MBA, media, law, arts, and other streams.</p>

<h3 class="has-neve-link-hover-color-color has-text-color" id="htoc-how-to-log-in-through-internshala">how to log in Internshala?</h3>



<p>if you already signup Internshala then ignore this step move to next.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Let see details about this step by step. first, <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.freelancer.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a> it redirects to the Internshala website. Then you find the <span class="has-inline-color has-nv-c-2-color">register</span><span class="has-inline-color has-neve-link-hover-color-color"> </span>button click that it shows two options select &#8220;<span class="has-inline-color has-nv-c-2-color">As a Student</span> &#8220;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="547" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1-1024x547.jpg" alt="Internshala " class="wp-image-925" title="Internshala Login page" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1-300x160.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1-768x410.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1-1320x705.jpg 1320w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Next step you will enter email, the first name, last name and password then click <span class="has-inline-color has-nv-c-2-color">signup</span>. After that, it sends a verification link through Gmail and verified it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="545" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_up2-1024x545.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-928" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_up2-1024x545.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_up2-300x160.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_up2-768x409.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_up2.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After verify your email it will redirects to personal details page.</p>



<p>Enter your details, and make sure given correct phone number, some organization make telephone interview. and  hit the <span class="has-inline-color has-nv-c-2-color">save &amp; next</span> button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="548" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_5-1024x548.jpg" alt="internshala" class="wp-image-931" title="internshala page " srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_5-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_5-300x161.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_5-768x411.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_5.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>then next page shows preferences select &#8221;Internships&#8221; after that it shows internship type looking for work from home or office . just select  Work from home because in this covid situation many organizations preferred WFH .</p>



<p>Next below you find which field is looking for an internship. select your interested internship. I give some basic field which all works have basic English knowledge  Digital marketing, marketing, sales, proofreading, social media marketing, transcription/ translation, campus ambassador, event management, data entry, teaching, volunteering. Then hit the<span class="has-inline-color has-nv-c-2-color"> save</span> button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="547" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_6-1024x547.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-932" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_6-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_6-300x160.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_6-768x410.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_6.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h3 class="has-neve-link-hover-color-color has-text-color" id="htoc-how-to-find-an-internship">how to find an internship?</h3>



<p>The dashboard shows a lot of internships in work from home. Normally first in the dashboard, it shows ongoing contest or online training skills, basically, it will be paid. After that, it shows a lot of free internships, scroll down, and see many opportunities.</p>



<p>But now we going to use filters, it saves maximum amount of time.</p>

<p></p>

</div>
</div>



<p>After that verified all details about the organization and you are ready to move to apply for an internship. Next, to click on  Apply now it redirects to add Education details page, if you already entered it redirects to your resume page. </p>



<h3 class="has-neve-link-hover-color-color has-text-color" id="htoc-h">How to add Education details in Internshala?</h3>



<p>If you are adding more details to your resume will increase your chances of getting selected. so fill in all possible entry. And also add accurate details.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="548" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E1-1024x548.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-975" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E1-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E1-300x161.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E1-768x411.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E1.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you are currently pursuing any degree then fill in college name, degree and stream name and also CGPA or percentage. </p>



<p>Add  your past study details 10th and 12th grade details too&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="has-neve-link-hover-color-color has-text-color" id="htoc-ho">How to add Experience, skills, work samples in internshala ?</h3>



<p>If you have worked previously any jobs then fill it in jobs and if you have completed any internships fill it in internship column. Most of the organization is looking for experienced person.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="547" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e2-1024x547.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-978" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e2-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e2-300x160.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e2-768x410.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e2.jpg 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>next skill, there is a real trick the organization got a lot of applications you want to be unique, Don&#8217;t put unrelated skills on that. For example, the company is related to web development then search google for what type of project is doing, they&#8217;re using WordPress or static pages. Then put on the skills they looking for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="503" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mc-1024x503.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-979" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mc-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mc-300x147.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mc-768x377.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mc.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But in most case we didn&#8217;t have any experience, then what you going to do is make your project and link into the Internshala. Let see how to do this. First make your project, if its project is related to web development make your own site and link it or if you good at coding then link it to your git hub account or if you are good at designing then link it to your Behance Portfolio or else if your project is not in this category, then share your project through google drive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="548" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/q-1024x548.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-980" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/q-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/q-300x161.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/q-768x411.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/q.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After all this completed it will generate your resume then you click proceed to application.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="546" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/r-1024x546.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-981" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/r-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/r-300x160.jpg 300w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/r-768x410.jpg 768w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/r.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Hey guys, the general meaning for 6G,5G,4G,2G is called the generation of the wireless network. When upgrading to a new version of the network the speed of the net will be high. Thinking about the first generation that time only mobile was invented and the mobile considers of 1kg weight. It cannot be used personally, but now you can use mobiles personally. When the generation upgrade the size of mobile reduces. In the same way, when the upgrade of generation of the wireless network the speed of the internet increases. </p>



<p>During 1G network usage, the message sending and receiving speed was 2.4kbps. (&#8216;kbps&#8217; is nothing kilobytes per second ) measuring unit of internet speed. During 2G  the speed was 40kbps, those time only you can use text message and picture message are introduced.</p>



<p>when coming to 3G, it was quite smarter and faster to use , compare to 2G and 1G.</p>



<p>But in 4G the speed of net was 500 times faster than 3G. when introduced 4G, we more used of youtube and more net consuming app are used at high speed </p>



<p>Next is about 5G, low latency network are fined, it is more used in the medical field and car companies. All the countries are moving on 5G nowadays, but in India, it will come soon.</p>

<p>Let see about our main topic 6G. The speed of 6G, was 11 Gbps, using this speed you can download 11 hours of video in few seconds. It is more used in mixed reality live cars, drone, robots. It is very important latern for the medical field. The speed of time was related to real-time speed. The 6G contains SUB MM waves in the ratio of 10:1 of 5G.</p>

<h2 id="htoc-covaxin-vs-covishield-difference-between-each-other">Introduction:<br> </h2>



<p>The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccine program has begun in India, and many people still do not know how the two vaccines &#8211; Covaxin and Covishield &#8211; differ from each other. Let see Covaxin vs Covishield.</p>



<p>The second phase started on March 1, when people over the age of 60 and those over the age of 45 with related comorbidities could take a life-saving gun.</p>



<p>Currently, the government does not allow people to decide which vaccine they want to receive, but the results of the first phase clearly show that both vaccines in India are safe and effective.</p>

<h2 id="htoc-what-should-you-find">What should you find?</h2>



<p>In India, more than 18.8Cr(Fully vacinated approx 3% of population in india) people have received COVID of two approved vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield. During the second wave of deadly coronavirus, the third vaccine COVID-19 was approved for use in India. Russia’s Sputnik V is considered safe and is similar to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made in India as ‘Covishield’.</p>



<p>Sputnik V offers 92% protection (approx.) On Covid-19 and has already arrived in India. The approval of this policy came at a time when India was crossing the border into Brazil to become the most affected nation with the global epidemic. With the Government launching the third phase of testing for 18 years and older, let&#8217;s take a look at where the preparation drug is best for you. Let see the major difference between Covaxin Vs covishield </p>

<h2 id="htoc-detailed-about-covaxin">Detailed about Covaxin:</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="272" height="185" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covaxin.jpeg" alt="Covaxin VS Covishield" class="wp-image-429"/></figure>



<p>Covaxin has been clinically shown to be effective in combating COVID-19, and it may also preventing mutant variants from spreading. While the vaccine is a traditional model and carries no side effects of reactogenic-side effects, research studies and data collected on vaccine have so far shown that in all vaccines, Covaxin brings a small number of side effects, such as fever, redness, cold or pain to the injection site.</p>



<p>Therefore, for someone who is in pain, or worried about side effects, choosing Covaxin may be the safest option, according to Dr. Kataria. It is also possible that side effects are milder, and make your vaccination experience safer.<br>Currently, Covaxin also has a shorter timeline of dosage, which means doses will be given outside of 4-6 weeks. One can also make the right decision, especially if they are committed to the future, or are at high risk for the dangers of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Those with a history or risk of hemorrhage(blood clotting) may also be advised to take Covaxin at present as a blood clot is a reported result of Covishield. However, it is still considered something ‘unusual’ .</p>



<h2 id="htoc-detailed-about-covidshield">Detailed about Covidshield:</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="205" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covishield.jpeg" alt="Covishield" class="wp-image-434"/></figure>



<p>Covishield has been one of the first approved vaccines and widely used in India, since January 2021. Although it is also a traditional vaccine, Dr. Kataria warns that young people, who prefer Oxford-Astrazeneca , often experience more serious side effects than those who receive Covaxin. Several reports also point out that Covishield shows a more immune response (hence, it makes way for more side effects).</p>



<p>The Covishield is also given primarily to the elderly or those with serious comorbidities. Those between the ages of 18-45 should also observe their health limits before registering for the vaccine.<br>However, talking about the benefits, Dr. Kataria added that Covishield puts in more antibodies, compared to Covaxin (although its performance levels are the same weight). Those with weakened immune systems may consider taking this action.</p>



<h2 id="htoc-conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>



<p> If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as vaccinated, physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. <strong>Do it all!</strong></p>

<h2 id="htoc-introduction">Introduction:</h2>



<p>What you want to do if you are not interested in engineering, but you have already joined an engineering college ??</p>



<p>If you like the course and want to be an engineer, then You can use the four years to improve your technical knowledge and explore your career options related to the field of engineering. </p>



<h2 id="htoc-basically-why-the-students-are-not-interested-in-engineering"><strong>Basically Why the students are not interested in engineering?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>There are two kinds of students who hate engineering;</strong></p>



<ul><li>First would be the student who is forced to do engineering against his/her interest.</li><li>The second is the student who would have joined the course with some interest but over a period of time, the academic and college stress would have destroyed all the interest and liking the student had for the engineering degree.</li></ul>



<p>If you hate engineering and if you want to change track to a non-engineering field after college, then it is better to start planning from your first or second year itself. First, take a month to cry and cry as much as you want for taking engineering. After you have cried enough, wipe your tears away and realize rest of the years you going to love your work.</p>



<h2 id="htoc-my-suggestion"><strong>My suggestion</strong>:</h2>



<p> Did you know, why many students join engineering colleges ?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="335" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/campus-placement.jpg" alt="Campus Placements " class="wp-image-136" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/campus-placement.jpg 600w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/campus-placement-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 id="htoc-try-to-place-a-company"><strong>Try to place a company</strong></h3>



<p>Even though you may not be interested in pursuing a career related to engineering or IT, it is financially safe to have a job at hand. Usually, there is a one year gap between your final semester exam and your date of joining. You can use this time to plan or prepare for your masters in a course where your interest lies. If your ultimate goal is to start your own business or social venture and if your parents are not financially well-off, you can use the employment to save for your future plans. However, you need to ensure that careers and the responsibilities of adult life.</p>



<h3 id="block-fe278650-f9b7-4d73-82fa-88abffa1905d"><strong>Fun tip: </strong></h3>



<p>If you get placed and reject the job offer, starting a non-engineering career path, adds glamour to your new venture. You can proudly say that you rejected a job offer at a Bangalore I.T. company to follow your passion.</p>



<h3 id="block-fe278650-f9b7-4d73-82fa-88abffa1905d1"><br><strong>Serious Tip:</strong> </h3>



<p>If your parents are very conservative and strict, you can use your campus placement as an escape route.</p>



<h3 id="htoc-try-to-place-a-company1"></h3>



<h2 id="htoc-take-up-an-internship"><strong>Take up an internship:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="335" src="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/take-up-an-internship.jpg" alt="Take up an internship" class="wp-image-140" srcset="https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/take-up-an-internship.jpg 600w, https://prakash-aathi.github.io/freaklac/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/take-up-an-internship-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p><br>There are two types of internships which you should take during college</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>At a company related to your course of study.</strong></strong><br>This is important because it will help you understand whether your mindset is suitable to work in that field for the rest of your life. If you are pursuing an electronic engineering course, apply for an internship in electronic companies, where you will get hands-on experience in the job profile of an electronic engineer; and you can check whether you are ready to push yourself every day of your life to design machines, draw circuits and develop signal systems. If possible, talk openly with the company’s manager and get a practical understanding of what you will be doing when you work in such a company.</li><li> <strong>Take an internship in the field of your choice.</strong><br>This second type of internship is for the large majority of our youngster are doing. If you want to be a writer, work at a bookstore or a publishing company. If you want to be a photographer, apply for a part-time photography assignment in a local magazine, <a href="http://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelancer</a>. Whatever your field of interest is, take a list of companies in that field and check for the ones in your city or nearer to your college. Tell them that you are considering a future in their field and you feel an internship there will help you assess your potential.</li></ul>



<h2 id="htoc-a-final-note-for-you-guys"><strong>A final note for you guys</strong>:</h2>



<p>Whatever your choice is, do realize that deviating from engineering is nothing to be ashamed of. Obviously, when you shift from engineering to non-engineering field, there will be arguments like, ‘you wasted four years in engineering’, ‘you could have given the engineering seat to someone else’, ‘you should have taken up arts’, etc.</p>



<p>It is better to waste the four years in engineering and shift to your field of interest now, instead of regretting when you are in your 40year&#8217;s that you have ended up wasting your entire life in pursuing a career without any interest. Cheers! all the best for your career.</p>
